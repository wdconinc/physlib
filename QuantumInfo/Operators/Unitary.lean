/-! # Unitary operators on quantum state

This file is intended for lemmas about unitary matrices (`Matrix.unitaryGroup`) and how they apply to
`Bra`s, `Ket`s, and `MState` mixed states.

This is imported by `CPTPMap` to define things like unitary channels, Kraus operators, and
complementary channels, so this file itself does not discuss channels yet. -/

/-- You might think this should only be true up to permutation, so that it would read like
`∃ σ : Equiv.Perm d, (ρ.U_conj U).spectrum = ρ.spectrum.relabel σ`. But since eigenvalues
of a matrix are always canonically sorted, this is actually an equality.

/-- The **No-cloning theorem**, saying that if states `ψ` and `φ` can both be perfectly cloned using a
unitary `U` and a fiducial state `f`, and they aren't identical (their inner product is less than 1),
then the two states must be orthogonal to begin with. In short: only orthogonal states can be simultaneously
cloned. -/
