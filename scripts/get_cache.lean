# Get cache

Downloads everything needed before a first build, so that `lake build` does
not have to compile from source.

Fetches both halves: Mathlib's prebuilt files (via Mathlib's own
`lake exe cache get`) and Physlib's own (via Lake's built-in `lake cache`,
backed by the project's R2 bucket -- see `lake-cache.toml` and
`docs/cache-setup.md`). Pass `--no-mathlib` to skip getting Mathlib's cache,
and `--no-alpha` to skip PhyslibAlpha's.

It can be run from the terminal using `lake exe get_cache`.

If you have no internet, `lake build` is just fine but will take much longer without this step
first.
