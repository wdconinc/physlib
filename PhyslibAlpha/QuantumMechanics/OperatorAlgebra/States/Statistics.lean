# State statistics

A state assigns real expectation values to observables. Centering observables
produces covariance and variance, the quantities used in uncertainty relations.

/-! ## Expectation -/

/-- The mean value a physicist would call `⟨a⟩`: the real number obtained by averaging repeated
measurements of `a` on systems prepared in state `ω`. Real (unlike the general complex-valued
`ω.toPositiveLinearMap`) since `a` is self-adjoint, see `state_is_real_on_selfAdjoint`. -/

observables: no information is lost, since self-adjoint elements have vanishing imaginary part. -/

/-! ## Centering -/

/-- The fluctuation of an observable around its mean: `a` with `ω⟨a⟩` subtracted off. Its
statistics (`covariance`, `variance`) describe the spread of `a`'s outcomes. -/
noncomputable def centered (ω : State A) (a : Observable A) : Observable A :=
  a - ω⟨a⟩ • 1

/-- A fluctuation has zero mean by construction: the average deviation from the average is zero. -/

/-- Shifting an observable by a deterministic constant `c` shifts its mean by `c` too, so the
fluctuation around the new mean is unchanged. -/

/-! ## Covariance and variance -/

/-- The correlation between two observables' fluctuations in state `ω`: the mean of their
symmetrized (Jordan) product once each is centered. Nonzero covariance means a measurement of `a`
carries statistical information about `b`. -/
noncomputable def covariance (ω : State A) (a b : Observable A) : ℝ :=
  ω⟨centered ω a ⊙ centered ω b⟩

/-- The spread of `a`'s measurement outcomes about its mean — the quantum analogue of a random
variable's variance, whose square root is the uncertainty `Δa` in `States.Uncertainty`. -/
noncomputable def variance (ω : State A) (a : Observable A) : ℝ :=
  covariance ω a a

/-- Unfolds `variance` as covariance of an observable with itself. -/
@[simp]
lemma covariance_self (ω : State A) (a : Observable A) :
    covariance ω a a = variance ω a :=
  rfl

/-- Variance is the expectation of the squared fluctuation about the mean. -/

    variance ω a = (ω ((centered ω a : A) * centered ω a)).re := by
  rw [variance, covariance]

  rw [Observable.jordan_self]

/-- Covariance is symmetric, because the underlying Jordan product is symmetric. -/
lemma covariance_comm (ω : State A) (a b : Observable A) :
    covariance ω a b = covariance ω b a := by
  simp only [covariance]
  rw [Observable.jordan_comm]

/-- Covariance depends only on fluctuations: shifting the left observable by a constant `c`
leaves it unchanged. -/
lemma covariance_add_smul_one_left (ω : State A) (a b : Observable A) (c : ℝ) :
    covariance ω (a + c • 1) b = covariance ω a b := by
  simp only [covariance, centered_add_smul_one]

/-- Covariance depends only on fluctuations: shifting the right observable by a constant `c`
leaves it unchanged. -/

    covariance ω a (b + c • 1) = covariance ω a b := by
  simp only [covariance, centered_add_smul_one]

/-- Repeated measurements of an observable can never have negative spread about their mean: the
physical content of variance being an honest measure of statistical uncertainty. Algebraically,
this is positivity of the state applied to the "square" `(centered a) ⊙ (centered a)`, which is
`(centered a)†(centered a)` in disguise (`Observable.jordan_self`). -/
lemma variance_nonneg (ω : State A) (a : Observable A) :
    0 ≤ variance ω a := by
