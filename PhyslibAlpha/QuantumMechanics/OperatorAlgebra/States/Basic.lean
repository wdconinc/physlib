# States on observable algebras

A state is a normalized positive complex-linear functional. It records the
expectation values of observables in a physical preparation.

    obtain ⟨C, hC⟩ := PositiveLinearMap.exists_norm_apply_le ω.toPositiveLinearMap

lemma toContinuousLinearMap_apply (ω : State A) (a : A) :
    ω.toContinuousLinearMap a = ω.toPositiveLinearMap a := rfl

/-- Restating normalization (`ω.map_one`) for the continuous-map bundling.

Not `@[simp]`: `toContinuousLinearMap_apply` already rewrites the left-hand side to
`ω.toPositiveLinearMap 1`, so this would not be in simp normal form. -/
lemma toContinuousLinearMap_one (ω : State A) :
    ω.toContinuousLinearMap 1 = 1 := ω.map_one

/-! ## Basic physical consequences -/

/-- A state is *-linear, not just linear: measuring `a†` and conjugating agrees with conjugating
the measurement of `a`. This forces self-adjoint (physically observable) elements to have real
expectation values. -/
@[simp]
lemma apply_star (ω : State A) (a : A) :
    ω.toPositiveLinearMap (star a) = star (ω.toPositiveLinearMap a) := by
  rw [map_star]

/-- `a†a` stands in for "the squared magnitude of `a`", so a state assigns it nonnegative
expectation. This makes `a ↦ ω(a†a)` a genuine (semi-)inner product, the seed of the GNS
construction. -/
lemma apply_star_mul_self_nonneg (ω : State A) (a : A) :
    0 ≤ ω.toPositiveLinearMap (star a * a) := by
  exact ω.toPositiveLinearMap.map_nonneg (star_mul_self_nonneg a)

/-- A state never reports an expectation value bigger than the observable's operator norm.
Proved via GNS Cauchy–Schwarz against the identity: `|ω(a)|² ≤ ω(1) · ω(a†a) ≤ ‖a‖²`. -/

/-- A state has operator norm exactly one: `norm_apply_le` gives `≤ 1`, and `‖ω(1)‖ ≤ ‖ω‖ * ‖1‖`
with `ω(1) = 1` forces `≥ 1`. Physically, a state neither amplifies nor damps observables. -/
