# Covariant measurements

A measurement is *covariant* under a symmetry when transforming the outcome and transforming the
assigned effect agree — a rotated detector, pointed at a rotated direction, reads out the same
statistics a rotation of the original detector would have. This file lays the foundation: a
measurable action of a group on the outcome space, a symmetry's action on effects (extending
`Symmetry`'s existing action on states, `OrderUnit/Symmetry.lean`, to the dual side), and the
covariance predicate on a POVM itself.

## Main definitions

- `Symmetry.instSMulEffect` : a symmetry acts on effects through the general
  `UnitalPositiveLinearMap.mapEffect` operation.
- `MeasurableAction G Ω` : `G` acts on `Ω` by measurable bijections.
- `EffectValuedMeasure.IsCovariant` : `μ (g • S) = ρ g • μ S`, the abstract form of
  `E(gS) = α_g(E(S))`.

section MeasurableAction

/-- `G` acts on the measurable space `Ω`, and every group element moves points measurably. Since
this holds for `g` and `g⁻¹` both, the action is by measurable *bijections*: `MeasurableSet.smul`
below shows it moves measurable sets to measurable sets, not merely points. -/

transported to the physical system via `ρ : G →* Symmetry E`, when transforming the outcome set

`E(gS) = α_g(E(S))` — a rotated detector pointed at a rotated direction reads out what a rotation
of the original detector would have. -/

/-! ## Covariant channels: the general intertwiner picture

Not every physical transformation has a measurable outcome space to be covariant "under" the way
a measurement is — a channel `φ : E₁ →ₚ₁[ℝ] E₂` between two systems is covariant simply when
transporting the input and transporting the output agree, with no measurable space in sight:
channels are also intertwiners. This is the general form; a covariant measurement (above) is the
special case where `E₂ = B_b(Ω,Σ)`'s dual role is replaced by `E₁` itself carrying the classical
outcome action. -/

/-- A channel `φ : E₁ →ₚ₁[ℝ] E₂` is **covariant** under symmetry actions `ρ₁`, `ρ₂` of `G` on the
two systems when transporting the input along `ρ₁ g` then applying `φ`, or applying `φ` then
transporting the output along `ρ₂ g`, agree — the channel intertwines the two actions. -/
