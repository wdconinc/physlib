# Weights

## i. Overview

A weight is a statistical weight: a number in `[0, ∞]` on each outcome saying how much of it
there is, with no requirement that the total be finite or normalized to 1 — hence the `∞` and
the fact that weights are compared, never subtracted. They live on `PosCone E`, the space of
possible outcomes from `OrderUnit/Basic.lean`.

Being an honest linear map, `Weight E` is automatically an `ℝ≥0`-module in its own right: combining
two weights with nonnegative coefficients is again a weight, for free, with no boundedness proof to
give (contrast `Effect`, a bounded slice of `E` that needs `Effect.convex` to stay closed under
mixing). `Weight.IsState.mix` is the one thing that *does* need proving: that this combination
preserves normalization when the coefficients sum to `1`.

## ii. Key definitions and results

- `Weight E`
- `Weight.IsFaithful`, `Weight.IsFinite`, `Weight.IsSemifinite`, `Weight.IsNormal` : the standard
  refinements.
- `Weight.IsState` : a finite weight normalized at the order unit — an actual state.
- `Weight.mix`, `Weight.IsState.mix` : mixing two (state) weights.
- `Weight.normalize` : normalization of a finite nonzero weight by its mass at the order unit.

on the finite-weight positive elements below it. -/

    w x = ⨆ y : {y : PosCone E // y ≤ x ∧ w y ≠ ⊤}, w y

/-- Every finite weight is semifinite: the element itself occurs among the finite elements below
it, while monotonicity bounds every other term by its value. -/

/-- A weight is finite everywhere exactly when it is finite at the order unit. The forward
implication is immediate; conversely, every positive element is bounded by a natural multiple of
the order unit, and monotonicity transfers finiteness down along that bound. -/

when that mass is finite and nonzero; keeping those hypotheses out of the definition makes the
underlying scaling operation available independently. -/
