# Normal channels

## i. Overview

A channel is normal when it preserves suprema of directed sets: its value at a directed supremum
is the supremum of its values on the directed set. This is the extra continuity — beyond mere
positivity — needed to push a countably-additive effect-valued measure forward along a channel and
keep it countably additive (`Measurement/MeasurableOutcome.lean`); it plays the same role for
channels that `Weight.IsNormal` plays for weights.

channels one canonical normality predicate. -/
