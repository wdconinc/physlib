# Trace-class operators

For `T : H →L[ℂ] H` on a complex Hilbert space `H`, `|T| := CFC.abs T = √(T⋆T)` (Mathlib's
continuous functional calculus absolute value). `T` is **trace class** if `∑ᵢ ⟪eᵢ, |T| eᵢ⟫`
converges for some Hilbert basis `{eᵢ}`; the **trace norm** `‖T‖₁` is that sum, and the **trace**
`Tr T := ∑ᵢ ⟪eᵢ, T eᵢ⟫` (which converges whenever the trace norm does, via Cauchy–Schwarz). The
Hilbert basis is quantified over `w : Set H` rather than an arbitrary index type `Type*` (matching
Mathlib's own `exists_hilbertBasis`, which produces exactly such a `w`) — every Hilbert space has
a basis indexed this way, so nothing is lost, and it keeps every index type in `H`'s own universe
rather than introducing a genuinely polymorphic (and, for a bare `Prop`-valued `def`, awkward)
universe parameter.

## Relationship to `HilbertSpace/Trace.lean`

`Trace.lean`'s `ContinuousLinearMap.traceₚ` is the ordinary linear-algebra trace
(`LinearMap.trace ℂ H T.toLinearMap`), bundled as a positive linear map: it is defined on *every*
`T : H →L[ℂ] H`, but is only the actual trace when `H` is finite-dimensional (`LinearMap.trace` is
`0` by convention outside that case, via `Module.finrank`-based junk value machinery upstream in
Mathlib — nothing in `traceₚ` needs or uses that convention explicitly). `IsTraceClass`/`trace`
here are the general infinite-dimensional notion: which *bounded* operators have a well-defined
trace via a convergent diagonal sum, before knowing anything about positivity or finite rank.
`trace_eq_sum_inner_hilbertBasis_of_finiteDimensional` below is the connecting fact: in finite
dimension, `LinearMap.trace ℂ H T.toLinearMap` — i.e. `traceₚ T` — agrees with the diagonal sum in
any Hilbert basis, and `HasFiniteMultiplicity.trace_eq_finrank_range_of_finiteDimensional` uses
this explicitly to reduce the finite-dimensional case of the new `trace` to the old one. No general
(infinite-dimensional) theorem "`traceₚ` agrees with `trace` whenever both are defined" is proved
here: `traceₚ` has no trace-class hypothesis to begin with (it is total, using `LinearMap.trace`'s
own junk-value convention outside finite dimension), so such a theorem would need to first isolate
exactly when the *linear-algebra* trace of an infinite-dimensional operator happens to coincide
with its analytic trace-class trace — genuine, unattempted work, not forced here.

Genuinely well-defined trace-class theory needs one famous, hard fact:

> the value of `∑ᵢ ⟪eᵢ, |T| eᵢ⟫` (hence trace-class-ness itself, and the value of the trace) does
> not depend on the choice of Hilbert basis `{eᵢ}`.

The positive/self-adjoint part is proved below (`summable_inner_abs_of_hilbertBasis`) directly
from Mathlib's `HilbertBasis` API — **not** via the unbounded spectral theorem. The route is the
standard Hilbert–Schmidt double-sum/Fubini argument: for a self-adjoint `S`, write
`⟪eᵢ, S eᵢ⟫ = ‖√S eᵢ‖²` (continuous functional calculus square root), expand `‖√S eᵢ‖²` via
Parseval against a *second* basis `{fⱼ}`, and swap the resulting (unconditionally
Fubini-swappable, since all terms are nonnegative and the outer sum is controlled by the
trace-class hypothesis) double sum `∑ᵢ∑ⱼ = ∑ⱼ∑ᵢ`. `|T| = CFC.abs T` is always self-adjoint, so
this handles `summable_inner_abs_of_hilbertBasis` in full generality. For `trace_eq_of_hilbertBasis`
the positive case is now proved by the same square-root/Parseval argument
(`trace_eq_of_hilbertBasis_of_nonneg`), and the self-adjoint case is obtained by decomposing into
positive and negative parts (`trace_eq_of_hilbertBasis_of_isSelfAdjoint`). The general
non-self-adjoint case would go through
the polar decomposition `T = U|T|` instead, and packaging the trace-class operators themselves as
a Banach space `TraceClass H` is separate, genuinely harder work; neither is attempted here.

## Definitions

- `IsTraceClass` : `T` is trace class.
- `traceNorm`/`trace` : witness-basis definitions of the trace norm and trace.
- `HasFiniteMultiplicity` : a projection is trace class — the honest Murray–von Neumann finiteness
  condition for "isolated eigenvalue of finite multiplicity", which a purely topological account of
  discrete spectrum cannot express.

Basis-independent trace for positive trace-class operators.

For a positive operator the absolute value is the operator itself.  Taking its continuous-
functional-calculus square root turns every diagonal coefficient into a squared norm, so the
Parseval double-sum theorem already proved above gives the same sum in every Hilbert basis.  This
is the positive case needed by density operators and does not use polar decomposition.
