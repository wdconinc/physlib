# Instruments

A finite-outcome instrument retains more than a measurement: not just the outcome probabilities,
but the transformed, post-measurement system too. It is a finite family of operations (one per
outcome, `Instrument.op`) whose images of the certain event sum to exactly `1` — the instrument as
a whole loses no probability, even though each individual operation may.

Forgetting the post-measurement state and keeping only the outcome probabilities recovers a
`Measurement` (`Instrument.measurement`); pairing a prior state with an outcome, when that outcome
has nonzero probability, gives the conditional (post-measurement, renormalized) state
(`Instrument.conditionalState`).

## Main definitions
