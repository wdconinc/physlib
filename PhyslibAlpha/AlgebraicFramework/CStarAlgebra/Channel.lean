# Quantum channels between C⋆-algebras

A quantum channel between C⋆-algebras is a *unital completely positive* (UCP) map: complete
positivity, not mere positivity, is the physically correct notion at this level, since a channel
must stay positive even after being applied to one half of a larger, entangled system — exactly
what `CompletelyPositiveMap` (`A₁ →CP A₂`, matrix-amplified positivity) already captures. This
sidesteps needing a tensor product of order-unit spaces (flagged as missing in
`OrderUnit/Channel/Basic.lean`): matrix amplification tests positivity against every finite-rank
bystander system without constructing a tensor product explicitly.

A UCP map is automatically positive (`CompletelyPositiveMapClass` gives `OrderHomClass`), so
`Channel A₁ A₂` restricts, on the self-adjoint parts, to the abstract order-unit-level notion
already built (`OrderUnit/Channel/Basic.lean`'s `UnitalPositiveLinearMap`):
`Channel.toUnitalPositiveLinearMap` is exactly this restriction, built from
`UnitalPositiveLinearMap.ofClass` (repackaging the `ℂ`-linear, positive, unital map as a
`UnitalPositiveLinearMap`) composed with `UnitalPositiveLinearMap.restrictSA`
(`StarAlgebra/Restrict.lean`), which uses exactly the positive/negative part decomposition of a
self-adjoint element (`SelfAdjointDecompose`, backed by the continuous functional calculus's
`posPart`/`negPart`, the same decomposition packaged at the observable level in
`CStarAlgebra/JordanDecomposition.lean`) to see that a self-adjoint input is sent to a self-adjoint
output.

## Main definitions

- `Channel A₁ A₂`
- `Channel.toUnitalPositiveLinearMap` : the restriction of a channel to self-adjoint parts, as a
  `UnitalPositiveLinearMap`.

/-- A channel restricts, on self-adjoint parts, to a `UnitalPositiveLinearMap`
(`OrderUnit/Channel/Basic.lean`). This packages the channel as a `ℂ`-linear unital positive map
(`UnitalPositiveLinearMap.ofClass`, using that complete positivity gives positivity, i.e.
`OrderHomClass`) and restricts it to self-adjoint elements (`UnitalPositiveLinearMap.restrictSA`),
which is well-defined because a self-adjoint element decomposes as a difference of nonnegative
elements (`SelfAdjointDecompose`, via the continuous functional calculus's `posPart`/`negPart`,
i.e. the Jordan decomposition of `CStarAlgebra/JordanDecomposition.lean`): the image of such a
decomposition under a positive map is again a difference of nonnegative, hence self-adjoint,
elements. -/
