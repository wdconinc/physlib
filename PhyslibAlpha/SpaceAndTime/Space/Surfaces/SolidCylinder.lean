## Solid cylinder surface in `Space 3`

The solid cylinder is the closed unit disk in `Space 2` extruded along the third coordinate.
It is the solid analogue of the spherical cylinder, in the same way that the solid sphere is the
solid analogue of the spherical shell. Like the solid sphere it is a region of positive ambient
volume, so the measure associated with it is built from the ambient volume of the cross-sectional
disk (the solid-sphere measure in `Space 2`) extruded along the axis, rather than a pushforward of
a lower-dimensional surface measure. The measure-zero requirement is therefore not applicable here
and is replaced by a statement that the solid cylinder has positive ambient volume.

## C. The distribution associated with the solid cylinder

/-- The distribution on `Space 3` corresponding to integration over a solid cylinder.
  One can roughly think of this distribution as taking a test function `f` to its integral against
  a mass, charge or current density spread over a solid cylinder. -/
