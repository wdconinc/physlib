# Twin Paradox

The twin paradox corresponds to the following scenario:

Two twins start at the same point `startPoint` in spacetime.
Twin A travels at constant speed to the spacetime point `endPoint`,
whilst twin B makes a detour through the spacetime `twinBMid` and then to `endPoint`.

In this file, we assume that both twins travel at constant speed,
and that the acceleration of Twin B is instantaneous.

The conclusion of this scenario is that Twin A will be older than Twin B when they meet at
`endPoint`. This is something we show here with an explicit example.

The origin of the twin paradox dates back to Paul Langevin in 1911.
