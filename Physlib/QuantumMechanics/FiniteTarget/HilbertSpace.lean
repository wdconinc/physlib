# The Hilbert space of a finite target quantum mechanical system

A finite target quantum mechanical system is one whose states live in a finite
dimensional Hilbert space, with the basis states labelled by a finite type `d`
(for example the sites of a finite lattice, or the levels of a qudit).

This file contains
- the definition of `FiniteHilbertSpace d`, the Hilbert space of such a system,
  as a structure wrapping `EuclideanSpace ℂ d`, together with the notation `𝓗[d]`;
- its vector space structure (`AddCommGroup` and `Module ℂ`), transferred from
  `EuclideanSpace ℂ d` along the equivalence `equivEuclidean`;
- its Hilbert space structure (`NormedAddCommGroup`, `InnerProductSpace ℂ`,
  `FiniteDimensional ℂ` and `CompleteSpace`), induced along `linearEquivEuclidean`;
- the standard orthonormal basis `basisFun`, whose elements are the states
  localized at the points of `d`.

TODO "To match this with the results currently in the `QuantumInfo` part of the library,
  we should:
  1. Define `FiniteHilbertSpace` as a structure with a single entry `val`, this
    should take as an input a finite and decidable type `d`. Below this type is
    taken as default to be `Fin n`.
  2. On this type we should then define the structure of an inner-product space, and a
    Hilbert space.
  3. We could then define the notation `𝓗[d]` to denote the Hilbert space corresponding
    to the type `d`.
  4. The results from `QuantumInfo/Finite/Braket.lean` can then be moved over
    to Physlib, and related to the definition of the Hilbert space here.
  Optional. Maybe it is worth moving these files to a directory called `States`, with
  the idea that it includes this definition of the Hilbert space, the
  definition of bras and kets, and the definition of mixed states. Maybe also
  parts of `./ResourceTheory/FreeState`."


/-- The Hilbert space of a finite target quantum mechanical system whose target is
  a finite type `d` with decidable equality.

  It is defined as a structure with a single field `val`, wrapping an element of
  `EuclideanSpace ℂ d` — the space of functions `d → ℂ` carrying the `L²` inner
  product `⟪ψ, φ⟫ = ∑ i, conj (ψ i) * φ i`. Using a structure in preference to
  `EuclideanSpace ℂ d` itself makes the Hilbert space of states a type of its own,
  with its own API and the notation `𝓗[d]`.

  Being finite dimensional, it is automatically a complete inner product space,
  that is, a genuine Hilbert space. -/

## The Hilbert space structure on `FiniteHilbertSpace d`

The norm and inner product are induced from `EuclideanSpace ℂ d` along
`linearEquivEuclidean`, making `FiniteHilbertSpace d` a finite dimensional
(and hence complete) inner product space, that is, a Hilbert space.
