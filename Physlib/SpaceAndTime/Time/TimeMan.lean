# The time manifold

In this module we define the type `TimeMan`, corresponding to the time manifold,
without any additional structures except an orientation, such as a choice of metric or origin.
I.e. it is a manifold diffeomorphic to `ℝ` with no additional structure.

If you are looking for a more standard version of time see the type `Time`.

`TimeMan` is sometimes called topological time, due to the absence of a metric, and its use in
topological field theories.

## Implementation details

The manifold `TimeMan` is defined via the type `ℝ`, and thus inherits a given choice
of map `TimeMan.val : TimeMan → ℝ`, which can be extended to a homeomorphism or a
diffeomorphism. When using `TimeMan.val`, one should be aware that using it does
constitute a choice being made.

## The topology on TimeMan.

The topology on `TimeMan` is induced from the topology on `ℝ`, via the choice
of map `TimeMan.val`.
