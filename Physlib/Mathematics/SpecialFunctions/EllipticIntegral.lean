# The complete elliptic integral of the first kind

This file may eventually be upstreamed to Mathlib.

## i. Overview

Legendre's complete elliptic integral of the first kind is, in the parameter convention,

`K(m) = ∫ φ in 0..π/2, (1 - m sin² φ) ^ (-1/2)`

(Abramowitz & Stegun 17.3.1). The physics literature more often uses the modulus convention and
writes `K(k)`, as Landau & Lifshitz do, for what is here `completeEllipticK (k ^ 2)`; the two
conventions are related by `m = k²`. Mathlib knows the Weierstrass elliptic function `℘`
(`PeriodPair.weierstrassP`) but has no Legendre-form elliptic integrals; this file defines the
complete integral of the first kind and develops its basic theory on the domain `m < 1`, where
the radicand `1 - m sin² φ` is positive and the integrand continuous.

The integral enters physics wherever a period or a potential is computed exactly rather than in a
small-parameter expansion. Physlib's use of it so far is the simple pendulum: released from rest
at amplitude `θ₀`, the pendulum has period `4 √(ℓ / g) K(sin² (θ₀ / 2))` (Landau & Lifshitz §11,
Problem 1), the consumer being `Physlib.ClassicalMechanics.Pendulum.SimplePendulum.PeriodFormula`.
More broadly, the complete integrals of the first and second kind give the magnetic field of a
circular current loop and the potential of a uniformly charged ring, and the second kind, `E`,
gives the arc length of an ellipse. This file defines `K` so that such results can be stated.

For `m ≥ 1` the definition still elaborates, but its value is not Legendre's. At `m = 1` the
integrand is `1 / cos φ`, which is not interval integrable on `[0, π/2]`, so the integral is `0`
by `intervalIntegral.integral_undef`, whereas `K(1) = ∞`. For `m > 1` the radicand is negative on
`(arcsin (1/√m), π/2]`, where the real power at exponent `-(1/2)` of a negative base vanishes
(`Real.rpow_def_of_neg` supplies the factor `cos (-(1 / 2) * π) = 0`), so the Lean value is the
finite positive integral over `[0, arcsin (1/√m)]`; by the reciprocal-modulus transformation this
is `K(1/m) / √m`, the real part of the complex Legendre integral (DLMF §19.7(ii)) — not proved
here. Every lemma of this file about a general parameter therefore carries its domain hypothesis
`m < 1` explicitly.

## A. Definition and the integrand

The integral is defined for every real parameter `m`; on the domain `m < 1` the radicand is
positive, so the integrand is continuous and interval integrable.

-/

/-- The complete elliptic integral of the first kind in the parameter convention,
`K(m) = ∫ φ in 0..π/2, (1 - m sin² φ) ^ (-1/2)`. The physics literature often writes `K(k)`
with `m = k²`. The integrand is written as a real power rather than `1 / √(…)` so that
continuity, positivity and monotonicity in `m` come from the `rpow` API (`Continuous.rpow_const`,
`Real.rpow_pos_of_pos`, `Real.rpow_le_rpow_of_nonpos`); the two forms agree by
`Real.sqrt_eq_rpow` and `Real.rpow_neg`. For `m ≥ 1` see the module docstring. -/

## B. Value at zero and positivity

At `m = 0` the integrand is the constant `1` and the integral is elementary; for `m < 1` the
integral is positive, being the integral of a positive continuous function.

## C. Monotonicity and bounds in the parameter

For fixed `φ` the radicand `1 - m sin² φ` decreases in `m`, so the integrand, a negative power of
the radicand, increases in `m` on the domain; integrating the pointwise inequality over
`[0, π/2]` gives monotonicity of `K`, and since the inequality is strict at `φ = π/2` the
monotonicity is strict. Together with `K 0 = π / 2` this bounds `K` below on `[0, 1)`; bounding
the radicand below by `1 - m` bounds `K` above by `π / 2 * (1 - m) ^ (-1/2)` there.

-/

/-- `completeEllipticK` is monotone on its domain: for `m₁ ≤ m₂ < 1`, `K m₁ ≤ K m₂`. The
integrand is pointwise monotone in the parameter, the radicand being positive for both
parameters. -/

## D. Continuity on the domain

The integrand is jointly continuous in `(m, φ)` on `(-∞, 1) × ℝ`, where the radicand is
positive, but not on all of `ℝ × ℝ`. Restricting the parameter to the subtype `Set.Iio 1` makes
the joint continuity global, so Mathlib's continuity of a parametric interval integral with
fixed endpoints (`intervalIntegral.continuous_parametric_intervalIntegral_of_continuous'`)
applies and gives continuity of `K` on the domain. Continuity at each point `m < 1` follows,
`(-∞, 1)` being a neighbourhood of `m`.
