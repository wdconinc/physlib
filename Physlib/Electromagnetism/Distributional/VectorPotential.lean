# The vector Potential

## i. Overview

The electromagnetic potential is given by
`A = (1/c φ, \vec A)`
where `φ` is the scalar potential and `\vec A` is the vector potential.

In this module we define the vector potential, and prove lemmas about it.

Since `A` is relativistic it is a distribution of `SpaceTime d`, whilst
the vector potential is non-relativistic and is therefore a distribution of `Time` and `Space d`.

## ii. Key results

- `DistElectromagneticPotential.vectorPotential` : The vector potential from an
  electromagnetic potential which is a distribution.
