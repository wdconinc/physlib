# A. Electromagnetism

Electromagnetism describes electric and magnetic fields, their potentials and sources, and the
relations between them on space and spacetime. This module provides a compact foundational API used
by more specialized electromagnetism modules in Physlib.

## A.1. Main definitions

The module contains coordinate-level types for electric and magnetic fields, a spacetime vector
potential, charge and current densities, and the constants describing an electromagnetic system.
For an `EMSystem`, it also defines the speed of light and Coulomb's constant in terms of the vacuum
permittivity and permeability.

## A.2. Current status

The definitions here are intentionally lightweight. More developed APIs are organized under the
`Kinematics`, `Dynamics`, `Distributional`, `ThreeDimension`, and `Vacuum` subdirectories. The
abbreviations in this file remain useful as shared entry points while those APIs continue to
converge.

## A.3. Future work

Charge and current densities should be generalized to signed measures while remaining convenient
for integration and tensor notation. As the specialized APIs stabilize, overlapping legacy
interfaces should be consolidated without breaking the physical meaning of existing declarations.
