# The ISQ base quantities

The International System of Quantities (ISQ), specified in ISO/IEC 80000-1 and
described in the International Vocabulary of Metrology (VIM, 3rd edition,
JCGM 200:2012), fixes seven mutually independent *base quantities*: length, mass,
time, electric current, thermodynamic temperature, amount of substance, and
luminous intensity.

`ISQDimensionBase` is that seven-element basis, realised as an instantiation
`Dimension ISQDimensionBase` of the parametric dimensional algebra. It differs from
PhysLib's default `LTMCTDimensionBase` in two ways:

* the electromagnetic base quantity is *electric current*, so electric charge is a
  *derived* dimension (`Q = I · T`, `ISQDimensionBase.charge`); and
* *amount of substance* and *luminous intensity* are additional independent base
  quantities.
