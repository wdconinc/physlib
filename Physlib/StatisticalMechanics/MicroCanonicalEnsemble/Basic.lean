## The Microcanonical Ensemble

-/

@[expose] public section

section ThermodynamicEnsemble

/-- The Hamiltonian for a microcanonical ensemble, parameterized by any extrinsic parameters of data
    D. Since it's an arbitrary type, 'T' would be nice, but we use 'D' for data to avoid confusion
    with temperature. We define Hamiltonians as an energy function on a real manifold, whose
    dimension n possibly depends on the data D. Energy is a WithTop ℝ, ⊤ is used to mean "excluded
    as a possibility in phase space". This formalization does exclude the possibility of discrete
    degrees of freedom; it is not _completely_ general. A better formalization could have an
    arbitrary measurable space.
