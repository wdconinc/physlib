# Continuity equation for fluid flows

## i. Overview

This module defines the classical conservative mass-balance equation for a fluid flow and the
corresponding continuity residual. These definitions are independent of a particular momentum
equation, so they can be reused by Navier-Stokes, Euler, and other fluid models.

## ii. Key results

- `FluidFlow.ClassicalContinuityEquation` : Classical conservation of mass in conservative form.
- `FluidFlow.continuityResidual` : The scalar residual `partial_t rho + div (rho u)`.
- `FluidFlow.SmoothContinuityEquation` : Continuity for globally differentiable fields.
- `FluidFlow.classicalContinuityEquation_of_smoothContinuityEquation` : A smooth continuity
  equation implies the classical continuity equation.

## A. Continuity equations

/-- Classical conservation of mass in conservative form, `partial_t rho + div (rho u) = 0`.

The equation is asserted at points where the time derivative of `rho` and the spatial
divergence of `rho u` are classical derivatives.

/-- A stronger continuity equation for globally differentiable fields.

This version records the first-order regularity needed by the classical continuity equation:
the density is differentiable in time, the mass flux `rho u` is differentiable in space, and
the continuity residual vanishes everywhere.
