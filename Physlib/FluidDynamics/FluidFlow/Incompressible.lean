# Incompressible fluid flows

## i. Overview

This module defines general incompressibility predicates for fluid flows. These predicates are
not tied to a particular equation of motion, so they can be reused later by incompressible
Navier-Stokes, incompressible Euler, and Bernoulli-style developments.

## ii. Key results

- `FluidFlow.incompressibilityResidual` : The divergence of the velocity field.
- `FluidFlow.ClassicalIncompressible` : Incompressibility guarded by velocity differentiability.
- `FluidFlow.SmoothIncompressible` : Incompressibility with globally differentiable velocity.
- `FluidFlow.classicalIncompressible_of_smoothIncompressible` : Smooth incompressibility implies
  classical incompressibility.
