# The Navier-Stokes equations

## i. Overview

The Navier-Stokes equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe
the motion of viscous fluid substances. They are fundamental in fluid dynamics and are
used to model the behavior of fluids in various contexts, including gas flow and water flow.

This file defines the Navier-Stokes equations as continuity, Cauchy momentum, and a Newtonian
stress law. The Cauchy momentum equation supplies the balance-law layer, while
`CauchyFlow.IsNewtonian` specializes the stress tensor through pressure and viscosity fields.

## ii. Key results

- `NavierStokes` : Classical continuity, Cauchy momentum, and Newtonian stress together.
- `ConvectiveNavierStokes` : Classical continuity, convective Cauchy momentum, and Newtonian
  stress together.
- `navier_stokes_iff_convective_navier_stokes` : Equivalence of the two forms when the fields
  are differentiable.
