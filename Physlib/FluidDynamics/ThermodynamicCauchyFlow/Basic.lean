# Basic predicates for thermodynamic Cauchy flows

## i. Overview

This module defines `ThermodynamicCauchyFlow`, the thermodynamic layer currently needed for
isentropic and Bernoulli-type statements.

This structure is intentionally the minimal carrier for the present thermodynamic API, not a claim
that entropy and enthalpy describe every thermodynamic process. Temperature, heat flux, and other
state data should be introduced by a further extension when an energy or heat-transport law needs
them. Keeping those fields out here lets Bernoulli and isentropic results avoid assumptions
unrelated to their statements.

/-- A Cauchy flow equipped with thermodynamic entropy and enthalpy fields.

These fields are independent of the kinematic and momentum-balance data unless additional
thermodynamic constitutive laws are imposed. They are sufficient for the current isentropic and
Bernoulli APIs; other thermodynamic fields belong in later extensions that require them. -/
