# Equilibria and energy regimes of the simple pendulum

## i. Overview

The equation of motion of the simple gravity pendulum, `I θ̈ = -m g ℓ sin θ` in the lifted
formulation of `SimplePendulum.Basic`, has two elementary consequences that follow from the
vanishing of the torque and from energy conservation alone, before any non-constant solution is
constructed. The first is the equilibria: the torque of gravity vanishes exactly where `sin θ`
does, so the constant lifts at the angle `0` — the bob hanging at rest below the pivot — and at
the angle `π` — the bob balanced above it — solve the equation of motion, and conversely a
constant lift is a solution only at the multiples of `π`. The second is the division of the
smooth motions into regimes by the value of the conserved energy. The threshold is the energy
`2 m g ℓ` of the inverted equilibrium, the separatrix energy: below it the potential energy
cannot reach its value at the top of the swing, so the bob never gets there — classically the
regime of libration, the bob swinging back and forth; above it the kinetic energy never
vanishes, so the bob never halts — classically the regime of rotation, the pendulum circulating
over the top. This is the phase portrait of the pendulum drawn in Arnold §4, whose level curves
of the energy are closed ovals below the threshold and unbounded waves above it.

As in `SimplePendulum.Basic`, the motion is written on the Euclidean lift
`Time → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)` of the angle. Only the bounds characteristic of each regime
are proved here: the librating and rotating motions themselves, and the instability of the
inverted equilibrium, are statements about non-constant solutions and are not constructed in
this module.

## ii. Key results

- `SimplePendulum.equationOfMotion_const_zero` and `SimplePendulum.equationOfMotion_const_pi`
  are the hanging and the inverted equilibrium, packaged as the simplest explicit solutions of
  the pendulum by `SimplePendulum.isSolution_const_zero` and `SimplePendulum.isSolution_const_pi`,
  and `SimplePendulum.equationOfMotion_const_iff` shows that the constant solutions are exactly
  the equilibria.
- `SimplePendulum.separatrixEnergy` is the energy `2 m g ℓ` of the inverted equilibrium
  (`SimplePendulum.energy_const_pi`), the threshold between libration and rotation.
- `SimplePendulum.neg_one_lt_cos_of_energy_lt`: below the threshold the bob never reaches the
  top of the swing. `SimplePendulum.deriv_ne_zero_of_energy_gt`: above it the angular velocity
  never vanishes. `SimplePendulum.potentialEnergy_eq_energy_of_deriv_eq_zero`: at a turning
  point the potential energy equals the total energy.

## A. Equilibria

The two configurations at which the torque of gravity vanishes — the bob hanging at rest below
the pivot and the bob balanced above it — give constant solutions of the equation of motion, the
simplest explicit solutions of the pendulum. This section verifies the two, and proves the
converse: a constant lift solves the equation of motion only where the torque vanishes, that is
only at the angles `π n`. The constant solutions are exactly the equilibria.

-/

/-!

### A.1. The hanging equilibrium

At the angle `0` the bob hangs at rest at the bottom of its swing. The lift is constant, so the
angular momentum does not change, and the torque vanishes with `sin 0`: both sides of the
equation of motion are zero.

-/

/-- The constant lift at the angle `0` — the bob hanging at rest at the bottom of its swing —
  satisfies the equation of motion of the simple pendulum. -/

### A.2. The inverted equilibrium

At the angle `π` the bob is balanced directly above the pivot, where the torque vanishes with
`sin π`; the pendulum stays there. That this balance is unstable — neighbouring solutions run
away from it — is a statement about non-constant solutions, and is not proved here.

### A.3. The constant solutions are the equilibria

For a constant lift the angular momentum does not change, so the equation of motion reduces to
the vanishing of the torque, that is to `sin θ = 0`, which holds exactly at the multiples of
`π`. The constant solutions are therefore exactly the equilibria: the hanging equilibrium, the
inverted equilibrium, and their copies shifted by whole turns.

-/

/-- A constant lift satisfies the equation of motion of the simple pendulum if and only if the
  sine of its angle vanishes — classically, the angles straight down and straight up: the
  constant solutions are exactly the equilibria. -/

## B. Energy regimes

Energy conservation divides the smooth motions of the pendulum into regimes according to the
value of the conserved energy, the threshold being the energy `2 m g ℓ` of the inverted
equilibrium. Below the threshold the potential energy cannot reach its value at the top of the
swing, so the bob never reaches the top; classically this is the regime of libration, the bob
swinging back and forth. Above the threshold the kinetic energy can never vanish, so the bob
never halts; classically this is the regime of rotation, the pendulum circulating over the top.
This is the phase portrait of the pendulum drawn in Arnold §4, whose level curves of the energy
are closed ovals below the threshold and unbounded waves above it. This section proves the
below- and above-threshold bounds characteristic of each regime, from two elementary bounds
relating the energies — the librating and rotating motions themselves are not constructed
here — and characterizes the turning points, the instants at which the velocity vanishes and
the potential energy exhausts the total energy.

-/

/-!

### B.1. The separatrix energy

The threshold between the regimes is the energy of the inverted equilibrium: no kinetic energy,
and the potential energy `2 m g ℓ` of the top of the swing. It is called the separatrix energy
after the curve it names in the phase portrait, the level set of the energy separating the
closed orbits of libration from the unbounded orbits of rotation. Only the threshold value is
used in this file: the separatrix motions themselves — the non-constant solutions asymptotic to
the inverted equilibrium — are not constructed here.

-/

/-- The separatrix energy of the simple pendulum is `2 m g ℓ`, the energy of the inverted
  equilibrium. It is the threshold separating the two regimes of the motion, libration below it
  and rotation above it. -/

### B.2. Energy bounds

Two elementary bounds drive the regime theorems: the kinetic energy is non-negative, so the
potential energy is at most the total energy; and the potential energy is non-negative, so
`I θ̇²` is at most twice the total energy. None of the bounds of this subsection uses the
equation of motion — they hold along every lift of the angle.

-/

/-- The kinetic energy of the simple pendulum is non-negative along every lift of the angle. -/

### B.3. Libration and rotation

Along a smooth solution with energy below the separatrix energy, the potential energy — being
at most the conserved total energy — stays strictly below `2 m g ℓ`, so the cosine of the angle
stays strictly above `-1`: the bob never reaches the top of the swing, and the motion is a
libration, swinging back and forth — though only the bound is proved here. Along a smooth
solution with energy above the separatrix energy the angular velocity can never vanish, for at
such an instant the whole energy would be potential, and the potential energy never exceeds
`2 m g ℓ`; the velocity being continuous, it keeps a fixed sign, and the motion is a rotation
over the top — though only the non-vanishing is proved here.

-/

/-- Libration: along a smooth lift of the angle satisfying the equation of motion, with energy
  below the separatrix energy, the cosine of the angle stays strictly above `-1` — the bob
  never reaches the top of the swing. -/

### B.4. Turning points

At an instant where the angular velocity vanishes the kinetic energy vanishes with it, and the
conserved total energy is purely potential. These are the turning points of the motion, where a
librating bob halts at the extremes of its arc before swinging back; by the rotation theorem of
B.3 they can occur only at energies not above the separatrix energy.
