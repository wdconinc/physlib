# The simple gravity pendulum

## i. Overview

A simple gravity pendulum is a bob of mass `m` fixed to one end of a rigid massless rod of length
`ℓ`, the other end of which is pinned at a pivot, swinging in a vertical plane under a uniform
gravitational acceleration `g`. Its configuration is the angle `θ` of the rod from the downward
vertical. The bob moves on the circle of radius `ℓ` about the pivot, so its moment of inertia
about the pivot is `I = m ℓ²` and its kinetic energy is `T = ½ I θ̇²`. Swinging out to the angle
`θ` raises the bob by `ℓ (1 - cos θ)` against gravity, so the potential energy is
`V = m g ℓ (1 - cos θ)`, normalized to vanish at the bottom of the swing. Balancing the rate of
change of the angular momentum about the pivot against the torque `-m g ℓ sin θ` of gravity gives
the equation of motion `I θ̈ = -m g ℓ sin θ`, equivalently `θ̈ + (g/ℓ) sin θ = 0`. The mass drops
out of the motion, which is governed by the single quantity `ω = √(g/ℓ)`, the angular frequency of
the small oscillations about the bottom.

The configuration of the pendulum is genuinely an angle modulo a full turn, an element of the
circle `SimplePendulum.ConfigurationSpace`. As for the harmonic oscillator, the dynamics in this
file are written instead on the Euclidean lift `Time → EuclideanSpace ℝ (Fin 1)`: the angle is
carried by a real number, from which the configuration is recovered by
`SimplePendulum.ConfigurationSpace.ofAngle`, and the one-dimensional Euclidean space stands in for
both the configuration space and its tangent space, so that the Euler–Lagrange operator of Physlib
applies verbatim. Two lifts differing by `2π n` describe the same motion: the invariance of the
dynamics under such shifts is proved in the module `SimplePendulum.LiftInvariance`, and the full
connection of the model here with the geometric configuration space is made in a later module.
The first consequences of the dynamics — the equilibria, and the below- and above-separatrix
energy bounds characteristic of libration and rotation — follow in `SimplePendulum.Equilibria`.

## ii. Key results

- `SimplePendulum` contains the input data of the problem: the mass `m` of the bob, the length `ℓ`
  of the rod and the gravitational acceleration `g`.
- `SimplePendulum.ω` is the angular frequency `√(g/ℓ)` of the small oscillations, and
  `SimplePendulum.inertia` is the moment of inertia `m ℓ²` of the bob about the pivot. They are
  tied together by `SimplePendulum.ω_sq_mul_inertia`, the identity by which the mass cancels from
  the equation of motion.
- `SimplePendulum.kineticEnergy`, `SimplePendulum.potentialEnergy` and `SimplePendulum.energy` are
  the energies, with the bounds `potentialEnergy_nonneg`, `potentialEnergy_le` and
  `potentialEnergy_eq_zero_iff`, the gradient `gradient_potentialEnergy` of the potential and the
  time derivatives `kineticEnergy_deriv`, `potentialEnergy_deriv` and `energy_deriv`.
- `SimplePendulum.lagrangian` is the Lagrangian `T - V` of the pendulum, and
  `SimplePendulum.torque` is the torque about the pivot, the generalized force conjugate to
  the angle.
- `SimplePendulum.EquationOfMotion` is the equation of motion `I θ̈ = τ(θ)`, with its scalar form
  `equationOfMotion_iff_scalar` and its independence of the mass `equationOfMotion_iff_of_eq_ω`;
  `SimplePendulum.IsSolution` is a smooth solution of it.
- `SimplePendulum.gradLagrangian` is the variational derivative of the action, computed by
  `gradLagrangian_eq_eulerLagrangeOp` and `gradLagrangian_eq_torque`.
- `SimplePendulum.equationOfMotion_iff_gradLagrangian_zero` identifies the equation of motion,
  for smooth lifts of the angle, with the vanishing of the variational derivative of the action,
  and `SimplePendulum.isSolution_iff` characterizes the solutions as the smooth critical points
  of the action.
- `SimplePendulum.energy_conservation_of_equationOfMotion`,
  `SimplePendulum.energy_conservation_of_equationOfMotion'` and
  `SimplePendulum.IsSolution.energy_eq` express the conservation of energy along the motions of
  the pendulum.

## A. The input data

We start by defining a structure containing the input data of the simple pendulum, and proving
basic properties thereof. The input data consists of the mass `m` of the bob, the length `ℓ` of
the rod, and the gravitational acceleration `g`; everything else in this file is built from these
three numbers.

-/

/-!

### A.1. The structure of the input data

The three numbers are carried by a structure, together with the positivity assumptions: a
pendulum with a massless bob, a rod of zero length or no gravity is not a pendulum.

-/

/-- The simple gravity pendulum is specified by the mass `m` of its bob, the length `ℓ` of its
  rod, and the gravitational acceleration `g`. All three are assumed to be positive. The
  configuration of the pendulum is the angle of the rod from the downward vertical. -/

### A.2. Simple inequalities for the input data

statements, which is the form in which the field-clearing tactics consume it.

## B. Frequency and moment of inertia

Two derived quantities control the dynamics of the pendulum: the angular frequency `ω = √(g/ℓ)`
of the small oscillations about the bottom of the swing, and the moment of inertia `I = m ℓ²` of
the bob about the pivot.

The mass enters the equation of motion only through `I`, where it cancels against the mass in the
torque of gravity; what survives is `ω`. The identity performing that cancellation is
`ω_sq_mul_inertia`.

-/

/-!

### B.1. The angular frequency

Linearizing `sin θ ≈ θ` about the bottom of the swing turns the equation of motion into that of a
harmonic oscillator of angular frequency `√(g/ℓ)`. The exact motion is not harmonic, but this
frequency is the natural time scale of the pendulum and appears throughout its analysis.

  frequency of the small oscillations of the pendulum about the bottom of its swing. -/

### B.2. The moment of inertia

The bob is a point mass at the fixed distance `ℓ` from the pivot, so the moment of inertia of the
pendulum about the pivot is `m ℓ²`. It is the coefficient relating the angular acceleration to
the torque, and so plays for the angle the role that the mass plays for a position.

  inertia of a point mass `m` at distance `ℓ` from the axis. -/

## C. The energies

The simple pendulum has a kinetic energy determined by the rate of change of its angle, and a
potential energy determined by the height of the bob, hence by the angle itself. These combine to
give the total energy of the pendulum.

Here we state and prove a number of properties of these energies, including the gradient of the
potential energy, which is the object entering the equation of motion.

-/

### C.1. The definitions of the energies

We define the three energies; it is these energies which control the dynamics of the pendulum,
through the Lagrangian.

  $\frac{1}{2} I ‖\dot θ‖^2$, where `I` is the moment of inertia about the pivot. -/

/-- The potential energy of the simple pendulum at the angle `x` is `m g ℓ (1 - cos (x 0))`, the
  work done against gravity in raising the bob from the bottom of the swing. It is normalized to
  vanish at the bottom. -/

### C.2. Simple equalities and bounds for the energies

Besides the definitional unfoldings, the potential energy of the pendulum is non-negative and
vanishes exactly at the bottom of the swing, just as the potential energy of the harmonic
oscillator is non-negative and vanishes exactly at the origin. What has no harmonic-oscillator
analogue is the upper bound: the potential energy of the pendulum is at most `2 m g ℓ`, its
value at the top of the swing.

### C.3. Smoothness of the energies and the gradient of the potential

The potential energy is a smooth function of the angle, and its gradient on the one-dimensional
Euclidean lift is `m g ℓ sin θ` times the unit vector of the angular coordinate. This gradient is
what the equation of motion balances against the angular acceleration, so we record it here, once.
The subsection also records that, along a smooth lift of the angle, each of the three energies is
a differentiable function of the time — differentiability in time along the lift, as distinct
from the differentiability in the angle of the potential energy — which is the differentiability
that the time derivatives of section C.4 consume.

### C.4. Time derivatives of the energies

For a general smooth lift of the angle, which need not satisfy the equation of motion, we can
compute the time derivatives of the energies. Each is an inner product against the angular
velocity: the equation of motion will be exactly the statement that the two contributions cancel.

## D. The Lagrangian

The pendulum is a conservative system, so its Lagrangian is the kinetic energy minus the potential
energy, `L = ½ I θ̇² - m g ℓ (1 - cos θ)`. As for the harmonic oscillator, it is defined as a
function on phase space, of the time, the angle and the angular velocity separately; that it is
`T - V` along a lift of the angle is then a lemma rather than the definition.

The Lagrangian carries no explicit time dependence, the pendulum being autonomous; the time
argument is kept because it is the type the Euler–Lagrange operator of Physlib expects.

-/

/-!

### D.1. The definition of the Lagrangian and equalities for it

The Lagrangian is written directly in terms of the moment of inertia and the potential energy,
so that the equalities below are the two ways of reading it: expanded in the input data, and as
the kinetic energy minus the potential energy along a lift of the angle.

### D.2. Smoothness of the Lagrangian

The Lagrangian is a smooth function of all of its arguments jointly. This is the hypothesis that
the Euler–Lagrange theorem of Physlib places on a Lagrangian, so it is recorded on the uncurried
form `↿S.lagrangian`.

### D.3. Gradients of the Lagrangian

The Euler–Lagrange operator is built from the two partial gradients of the Lagrangian. The
gradient in the angle is minus the gradient of the potential energy, that is the torque of
section E; the gradient in the angular velocity is the angular momentum `I θ̇`.

## E. The torque and the equation of motion

Gravity exerts on the bob a torque `-m g ℓ sin θ` about the pivot, the generalized force conjugate
to the angle, and the equation of motion balances it against the rate of change `I θ̈` of the
angular momentum.

We take that pointwise relation as the definition of the equation of motion, rather than the
vanishing of the variational derivative of the action, which is how the harmonic oscillator defines
its own. The reason is that the variational derivative is defined to be `0` whenever no variational
gradient exists, so its vanishing holds vacuously for every lift of the angle too rough to admit
one; it says what it is meant to say only under a smoothness assumption. The pointwise equation is
totalized too — `∂ₜ` is `fderiv`, which is `0` off differentiability — but its totalization cannot
make the equation vacuously true: both sides remain genuine, and generally unequal, functions of
time. A rough lift can still satisfy the equation accidentally — a discontinuous lift hopping
between equilibrium angles solves it, as section E.3 explains — which is why the notion of a
solution, `IsSolution`, demands smoothness as well. It is also the form in which the equation of
motion is solved and used. The two agree for smooth lifts, by
`equationOfMotion_iff_gradLagrangian_zero` of section G, which is one rearrangement away from
`gradLagrangian_eq_torque` of section F.

-/

### E.1. The torque

The pendulum is conservative, so the generalized force conjugate to the angle is minus the
gradient of the potential energy. It is a torque about the pivot rather than a force, the angle
being the coordinate; this is why it is `m g ℓ sin θ` and not `m g sin θ`.

### E.2. The equation of motion

The equation of motion of the simple pendulum equates the rate of change of the angular momentum
about the pivot with the torque of gravity, at every instant.

-/

/-- The equation of motion of the simple pendulum: at every instant the rate of change `I θ̈` of
  the angular momentum about the pivot equals the torque `τ(θ)` of gravity.

  This pointwise relation, and not the vanishing of the variational derivative of the action, is
  the definition of the equation of motion here; see the discussion in section E. For a smooth
  lift of the angle the two agree, by `equationOfMotion_iff_gradLagrangian_zero` of section G. -/

  instant the rate of change `I θ̈` of the angular momentum plus the gradient of the potential
  energy vanishes. This is the rotational form of Newton's second law, in the shape in which
  `DampedHarmonicOscillator` states its own; the sum on the left is exactly the combination that
  `energy_deriv` pairs with the velocity `∂ₜ θ`. -/

### E.3. Smooth solutions

A solution of the pendulum is a smooth lift satisfying the equation of motion. Smoothness is part
of the definition because the bare pointwise equation, being totalized, admits unphysical
solutions: a lift jumping between the equilibrium angles `0` and `π` has zero torque everywhere,
and — being locally constant wherever it is differentiable at all — it has `∂ₜ θ`, and hence
`∂ₜ (∂ₜ θ)`, identically zero, so it satisfies the equation even when it is nowhere continuous.
Demanding smoothness excludes such junk, and is the regularity under which the variational
description of the motion agrees with the pointwise one.

### E.4. The scalar equation and independence of the mass

The angle is a single number, so the vector equation of motion is equivalent to the scalar
equation obtained by reading off its one component. Dividing that component by the moment of
inertia, using `ω_sq_mul_inertia`, cancels the mass and leaves `θ̈ + ω² sin θ = 0`: two pendulums
with the same `ω = √(g/ℓ)` have exactly the same angular motions, whatever their masses.

## F. The variational derivative of the action

The action of the simple pendulum is the time integral of the Lagrangian along a lift of the
angle. Its variational derivative is computed here, in two steps: it is the Euler–Lagrange
operator of the Lagrangian, and that operator is the torque minus the rate of change of the
angular momentum.

-/

/-!

### F.1. The definition of the variational derivative

The variational derivative is that of Physlib's variational calculus, applied to the action of the
pendulum. Recall that it is defined to be `0` when no variational gradient exists, so the lemmas
below are stated for smooth lifts of the angle.

-/

/-- The variational derivative of the action of the simple pendulum, the action being the time
  integral of the Lagrangian along a lift of the angle. -/

/-!

### F.2. Equality with the Euler–Lagrange operator

For a smooth lift of the angle the variational derivative of the action is the Euler–Lagrange
operator of the Lagrangian, by the general theorem `euler_lagrange_varGradient`; the hypotheses
of that theorem are the smoothness of the lift and `contDiff_lagrangian`.

-/

/-- For a smooth lift of the angle the variational derivative of the action of the simple
  pendulum is the Euler–Lagrange operator of its Lagrangian. -/

### F.3. The variational derivative in terms of the torque

Evaluating the Euler–Lagrange operator with the gradients of section D.3 gives the variational
derivative as the torque minus the rate of change of the angular momentum. Its vanishing is
therefore the equation of motion of section E; that equivalence is
`equationOfMotion_iff_gradLagrangian_zero` of section G.

-/

/-- For a smooth lift of the angle the variational derivative of the action of the simple
  pendulum is the torque minus the rate of change `I θ̈` of the angular momentum. -/

## G. Equation of motion and the variational principle

Section E took the pointwise balance of the angular momentum's rate of change against the torque
as the definition of the equation of motion, and section F computed the variational derivative of
the action. This section proves that for smooth lifts of the angle the two agree: the pointwise
law is exactly the Euler–Lagrange equation of the action, the statement that the motion is a
critical point of the action. The equivalence holds only under smoothness — the variational
derivative is `0` by convention on lifts too rough to admit a variational gradient, so on such
lifts its vanishing says nothing — which is why section E took the pointwise form as primary.

-/

/-!

### G.1. Equivalence with the vanishing of the variational derivative

By `gradLagrangian_eq_torque` the variational derivative of the action along a smooth lift is
the torque minus the rate of change of the angular momentum, so its vanishing is a rearrangement
of the equation of motion.

-/

/-- For a smooth lift of the angle the equation of motion of the simple pendulum holds if and
  only if the variational derivative of the action vanishes: the smooth motions of the pendulum
  are the critical points of its action. -/

### G.2. The variational characterization of solutions

A solution was defined in section E.3 as a smooth lift satisfying the equation of motion.
Substituting the equivalence of G.1 for the equation of motion turns this into the variational
characterization: the solutions of the pendulum are exactly the smooth lifts of the angle along
which the variational derivative of the action vanishes.

-/

/-- A lift of the angle is a solution of the simple pendulum if and only if it is smooth and the
  variational derivative of the action vanishes along it. -/

## H. Energy conservation

The pendulum is conservative: along any smooth lift of the angle satisfying the equation of
motion the energy is constant. No computation remains to be done here: by `energy_deriv` the
rate of change of the energy is the angular velocity paired with the sum of `I θ̈` and the
gradient of the potential, and the equation of motion is exactly the vanishing of that sum.

-/

/-!

### H.1. Energy conservation in terms of time derivatives

The first form of energy conservation: the time derivative of the energy vanishes identically
along any smooth lift of the angle satisfying the equation of motion.

  the energy of the simple pendulum vanishes. -/

### H.2. Energy conservation in terms of constant energy

The second form: the energy is differentiable in time along a smooth lift of the angle, so the
vanishing of its derivative makes it a constant function of the time, equal to its initial
value.

-/

/-- Along a smooth lift of the angle satisfying the equation of motion the energy of the simple
  pendulum at any time is equal to its initial value. -/

### H.3. Energy conservation for solutions

two components of being a solution, so for solutions conservation takes its most compact form.

  value. -/
