# The Hamiltonian formulation of the simple pendulum

## i. Overview

This module gives the Hamiltonian formulation of the simple gravity pendulum, on the same
one-dimensional Euclidean lift of the angle as `SimplePendulum.Basic`. The canonical momentum
conjugate to the angle is the gradient of the Lagrangian in the angular velocity, the angular
momentum `p = I θ̇` about the pivot; since the moment of inertia is positive, taking the
canonical momentum is a linear equivalence between velocities and momenta. The Hamiltonian is
the Legendre transform `H = ⟪p, θ̇⟫ - L` of the Lagrangian, which works out to the energy
written on momentum-angle phase space, `H(t, p, θ) = ½ (1/I) ‖p‖² + V(θ)`; along any lift of
the angle it is the energy of the lift. Hamilton's equations for the pendulum are packaged, as
for the harmonic oscillator, into the vanishing of an operator on phase space, and for a smooth
lift of the angle they are equivalent to the equation of motion of `SimplePendulum.Basic`.

## ii. Key results

- `SimplePendulum.canonicalMomentum` is the canonical momentum `p = ∂L/∂θ̇ = I θ̇`, as a
  linear equivalence between velocities and momenta, with its value recorded by
  `canonicalMomentum_eq`.
- `SimplePendulum.hamiltonian` is the Legendre transform of the Lagrangian, computed by
  `hamiltonian_eq` to be `½ (1/I) ‖p‖² + V(θ)`, smooth by `hamiltonian_contDiff`, with the
  two partial gradients `gradient_hamiltonian_position_eq` and
  `gradient_hamiltonian_momentum_eq`.
- `SimplePendulum.hamiltonian_eq_energy` identifies the Hamiltonian, evaluated along any lift
  of the angle on its canonical momentum, with the energy of the lift.
- `SimplePendulum.hamiltonEqOp` is the operator on momentum-angle phase space whose vanishing
  is Hamilton's equations, and `SimplePendulum.equationOfMotion_iff_hamiltonEqOp_eq_zero`
  proves that, for a smooth lift of the angle, Hamilton's equations are equivalent to the
  equation of motion.
- `SimplePendulum.equationOfMotion_tfae` gathers the formulations into a single equivalence:
  for a smooth lift of the angle the equation of motion, its scalar form `θ̈ + ω² sin θ = 0`,
  Hamilton's equations, and the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian variational principles are all
  equivalent.

## A. The canonical momentum and the Hamiltonian

We now turn to the Hamiltonian formulation of the simple pendulum. We define the canonical
momentum and the Hamiltonian, relate the Hamiltonian to the energy, and show that the equation
of motion is equivalent to Hamilton's equations.

### A.1. The canonical momentum

We define the canonical momentum as the gradient of the Lagrangian with respect to the angular
velocity. By `gradient_lagrangian_velocity_eq` this is the angular momentum `I θ̇` about the
pivot, and since the moment of inertia is positive it is a linear equivalence between
velocities and momenta.

### A.2. The Hamiltonian

The Hamiltonian is defined as a function of time, canonical momentum and angle, as the
Legendre transform
```
H = ⟪p, θ̇⟫ - L(t, θ, θ̇)
```
where the angular velocity `θ̇` is a function of `p` and `θ` through the inverse of the
canonical momentum.

-/

/-- The Hamiltonian of the simple pendulum as a function of time, momentum and angle: the
  Legendre transform `H(t, p, θ) = ⟪p, θ̇⟫ - L(t, θ, θ̇)` of the Lagrangian, the angular
  velocity `θ̇` being recovered from the momentum by inverting the canonical momentum. -/

#### A.2.1. Equality for the Hamiltonian

We prove a simple equality for the Hamiltonian, to help in computations: it is the kinetic
energy written in terms of the momentum, plus the potential energy.

#### A.2.3. Gradients of the Hamiltonian

We now write down the gradients of the Hamiltonian with respect to the angle and the momentum.
These are the two sides of Hamilton's equations.

  potential energy, that is minus the torque. -/

### A.3. Relation between Hamiltonian and energy

We show that the Hamiltonian, evaluated along any lift of the angle on the canonical momentum
of the lift, is the energy. This is independent of whether the lift satisfies the equation of
motion or not.

-/

/-- Along any lift of the angle, the Hamiltonian of the simple pendulum evaluated on the
  canonical momentum of the lift is the energy of the lift. This holds whether or not the lift
  satisfies the equation of motion. -/

### A.4. Hamilton equation operator

We define the operator on momentum-angle phase space whose vanishing is equivalent to
Hamilton's equations.

  momentum-angle phase space; its vanishing is equivalent to Hamilton's equations for the

### A.5. Equation of motion if and only if Hamilton's equations

We show that, for a smooth lift of the angle, the equation of motion is equivalent to
Hamilton's equations for the lift and its canonical momentum, that is to the vanishing of the
Hamilton equation operator on the pair. The equation for the angle recovers the angular
velocity, and the equation for the momentum is the balance of the rate of change of the
angular momentum against the torque.

-/

/-- For a smooth lift of the angle the equation of motion of the simple pendulum holds if and
  only if Hamilton's equations hold for the lift and its canonical momentum, that is if and
  only if the Hamilton-equations operator vanishes on the pair. -/

## B. Equivalences between the formulations

We gather the formulations of the dynamics of the simple pendulum into a single equivalence.
For a smooth lift of the angle the equation of motion, its scalar form, Hamilton's equations,
the Lagrangian variational principle and the Hamiltonian variational principle are all
equivalent. The equation of motion is itself the Newtonian formulation: the pointwise law is
the rotational form of Newton's second law, so, unlike for the harmonic oscillator, no
separate entry restates it. The equivalence of the equation of motion with the vanishing of
the variational derivative of the action lives in section G.1 of the `Basic` module; the
fourth entry states the same variational principle through the variational calculus directly.

-/

/-- For a smooth lift of the angle the following formulations of the dynamics of the simple
  pendulum are equivalent:
  1. the equation of motion, the pointwise rotational Newton law balancing the rate of change
    of the angular momentum against the torque;
  2. the scalar mass-independent form `θ̈ + ω² sin θ = 0` of the equation of motion;
  3. Hamilton's equations for the lift and its canonical momentum, as the vanishing of the
    Hamilton-equations operator;
  4. the Lagrangian variational principle, the vanishing of the variational gradient of the
    action integral of the Lagrangian, written through the variational calculus directly; the
    same principle, through the variational derivative of the action, is recorded standalone
    as `equationOfMotion_iff_gradLagrangian_zero` in the `Basic` module;
  5. the Hamiltonian variational principle, the vanishing of the variational gradient of the
    phase-space action on the pair of the canonical momentum and the lift. -/
